**Nov 01 2018**: Found Spearman's correlation coefficient value. The function also returns p-values, but these seem to indicate the probability that uncorrelated data generated the correlation values. Only 3% of these are above 0.05, so we can safely assume that all the correlation coefficients are correct. In addition, there are many correlations, and all seem to be positive. I confirmed this by first checking the fraction of values that were above a threshold, say 0.8, and then checking the fraction that were either above 0.8 or below -0.8. Both values were the same
